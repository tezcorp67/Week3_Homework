# Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers and "Odd" for odd numbers

#write func that takes in an int
#evaluate wether that int is even or odd
#using an if statement combined with % to s=check remainder of division by 2
#return string of Even or Odd depending on the num

#def info(self):
    #print(f'{s}')               

#def even_or_odd(num):
    #if num % 2 == 0:
        #return "Even"
   # else:
        #return "Odd"
    
#print(even_or_odd(11))
